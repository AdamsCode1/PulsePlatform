# DEPLOYMENT FIX - Step by Step Solution

## The Problem
Vercel serverless functions don't work well with full Express apps. The "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" error occurs because we're trying to deploy Express in a way Vercel doesn't support well.

## SOLUTION: Two-Step Deployment (Recommended)

### Step 1: Deploy Frontend Only (Fix Current Error)

**Current Status:** Frontend deployment is fixed and will work now.

1. **Commit current changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix frontend deployment - remove serverless function config"
   git push
   ```

2. **Result:** Frontend will deploy successfully to `https://www.dupulse.co.uk`

### Step 2: Deploy Backend Separately (Best Practice)

**Option A: Railway (Recommended - Easier for Express)**

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect GitHub â†’ Import `AdamsCode1/PulsePlatform`
3. Set Root Directory: `server/`
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy

**Option B: Render**

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. New Web Service â†’ Connect GitHub
3. Root Directory: `server/`
4. Build Command: `npm install`
5. Start Command: `node index.js`

**Option C: Vercel (Separate Project)**

1. Create new Vercel project
2. Import same repo
3. Root Directory: `server/`
4. Framework: Other

### Step 3: Connect Frontend to Backend

Set environment variable in frontend Vercel project:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
```

## Why This Is Better

âœ… **Cleaner separation** - Frontend and backend independent  
âœ… **Easier debugging** - Clear error isolation  
âœ… **Better performance** - Each optimized for its purpose  
âœ… **Standard practice** - How most production apps work  

## Quick Fix Right Now

1. **Deploy frontend only** (current config will work)
2. **Set up backend later** when you have time
3. **Temporarily use mock data** if needed

The current `vercel.json` is now configured for frontend-only deployment, which will work! ðŸš€
